# Machine Learning in Production

This Flask tool was developed for the DailyDrip "Machine Learning in Production" tutorial.
It predicts the click-through rate from The Avazu Kaggle dataset/competition with Machine Learning models.

The tool performs the following steps:
- Loads and transforms data
- Trains and tests different ML models
- Creates an API to get a few features and return the probability of the user clicking an ad.
